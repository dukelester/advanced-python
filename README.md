# Metaprogramming with Python is a practical guide to learning metaprogramming in Python

In todayâ€™s programming world, Python is considered one of the easiest languages to learn and use to
develop useful applications. Understanding the programming concepts and applying them is easier
in Python compared to any other programming language. A Python program can be written simply
by adding existing libraries and making use of their inbuilt methods. At the same time, the language
also has many powerful features that can help in developing robust libraries and applications.
This book covers the need for one of the most advanced features in Python, called metaprogramming,
along with insights into its practical applications. Understanding the concepts of metaprogramming
helps in tapping into the advanced features of Python 3 and knowing where to apply them to make
Python code more reusable.
Unlike the regular Python-based application development that follows object-oriented programming,
metaprogramming covers certain advanced concepts of Python that deal with manipulating the
programmable objects of Python, such as its classes, methods, functions, and variables. Throughout
this book, we will look at applications and examples that help in understanding these concepts in a
user-friendly manner.
