# Decorators

Decorators are one of the metaprogramming concepts that deal with decorating a function without
modifying the actual function body. As the name suggests, a decorator adds additional value to a
function, a method, or a class by allowing the function to become an argument of another function
that decorates or gives more information on the function, method, or class being decorated. Decorators
can be developed on an individual user-defined function or on a method that is defined inside a class,
or they can be defined on a class itself too. Understanding decorators will help us to enhance the
reusability of functions, methods, and classes by manipulating them externally without impacting
the actual implementation.
We will be taking a look at the following main topics:
    • Looking into simple function decorators
    • Exchanging decorators from one function to another
    • Applying multiple decorators to one function
    • Exploring class decorators
    • Getting to know built-in decorator
